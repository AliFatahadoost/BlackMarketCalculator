            <h3>in the API that this site uses it says it's not a bannable offense to use external info and this sites api is not mining any data from the game
                and it's getting it info from some users sharing info to the api and other then that there is no way that the anti-cheat detects it since it's just a site that is
                is open on your browser and i have used a custom version for 2 years now so, i believe it's not bannable BUT it's your account and 
                do what ever you think is safest for your account i'm not accepting any credibility for it

                it takes material prices from the api for the city you tell it to. after that it checks if the none-artifact weapons or armors are profitable if they are and the
                profit margin is larger then the number you tell it, after that it's gonna go through a list of items and sees if they sell for a higher price
                then the crafting cost plus your profit margin, if they do they are gonna be displayed. in addition to that you are gonna see how many
                of what resourse you need to craft the items and how many of which item you should craft for it to sell fast.
